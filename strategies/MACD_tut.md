Moving Average Convergence Divergence

If you are using the MACD as an entry signal, there are several indicators and techniques you can use to confirm the signal. 
Here are a few options:

Moving Averages: 
    You can use moving averages as a confirmation tool to confirm the trend identified by the MACD. 
    If the MACD indicates a bullish trend, you can confirm it by looking for the price to be above a long-term moving average, 
    such as the 200-day moving average. 
    Conversely, if the MACD indicates a bearish trend, you can confirm it by looking for the 
    price to be below a long-term moving average.

Relative Strength Index (RSI): 
    You can use the RSI as a confirmation tool to confirm the momentum of the trend identified by the MACD. 
    If the MACD indicates a bullish trend, you can confirm it by looking for the RSI to be above 50 and rising. 
    Conversely, if the MACD indicates a bearish trend, you can confirm it by looking for the RSI to be below 50 and falling.

Price Action: 
    You can use price action as a confirmation tool to confirm the trend identified by the MACD. 
    Look for bullish or bearish price action to confirm the trend direction. 
    For example, if the MACD indicates a bullish trend, you can look for bullish candlestick patterns, 
    such as a hammer or engulfing pattern, to confirm the trend.

Volume: 
    You can use volume as a confirmation tool to confirm the strength of the trend identified by the MACD. 
    Look for increasing volume during a bullish trend or decreasing volume during a bearish trend to confirm the trend direction.
